Configure the Network Settings:

Static IP Address:
Open Control Panel.
Go to Network and Sharing Center > Change adapter settings.
Right-click on the network adapter and select Properties.
Select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) and click Properties.
Set a static IP address. For example:

IP address: 192.168.1.10
Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
Default gateway: 192.168.1.1
Preferred DNS server: 192.168.1.10 (or use an external DNS server like 8.8.8.8 for now)

Next, I installed the Active Directory Domain Services and promoted that server to a domain controller.
