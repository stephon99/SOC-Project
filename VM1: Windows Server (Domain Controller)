Configure the Network Settings:

Static IP Address:
Open Control Panel.
Go to Network and Sharing Center > Change adapter settings.
Right-click on the network adapter and select Properties.
Select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) and click Properties.
Set a static IP address. For example:

IP address: 192.168.1.10
Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
Default gateway: 192.168.1.1
Preferred DNS server: 192.168.1.10 (or use an external DNS server like 8.8.8.8 for now)

Next, I installed the Active Directory Domain Services and promoted that server to a domain controller. 

Promote the Server to a Domain Controller:

Once the installation is complete, a flag with a warning symbol will appear in the Server Manager dashboard. Click on it and then click Promote this server to a domain controller.
Deployment Configuration:
Choose Add a new forest and provide a root domain name (e.g., example.local).
Click Next.
Domain Controller Options:
Choose the Forest functional level and Domain functional level (Windows Server 2016 is a good choice for both).
Enter a Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) password.
Click Next.
DNS Options:
You may see a warning about DNS delegation. Click Next.
Additional Options:
Verify the NetBIOS name assigned to the domain and click Next.
Paths:
Accept the default paths for the database, log files, and SYSVOL. Click Next.
Review Options:
Review your selections and click Next.
Prerequisites Check:
The wizard will run a prerequisites check. If everything is in order, click Install.
Reboot:
The server will automatically reboot once the installation is complete.
