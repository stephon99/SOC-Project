### Project Overview and Goals

#### Project Title: ThreatWatch: Simulated SOC Environment with ELK Stack

#### Project Overview:
This project aims to create a simulated Security Operations Center (SOC) environment using the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for threat detection and incident response. The environment will include a virtualized network with multiple virtual machines (VMs) to mimic a real-world IT infrastructure. The project will demonstrate practical skills in log collection, processing, and analysis using the ELK Stack, as well as the ability to detect and respond to security incidents.

#### Project Goals:
1. **Setup and Configuration:**
   - Create a network of virtual machines (VMs) using VMware Workstation.
   - Install and configure the ELK Stack on an Ubuntu server to function as the SIEM tool.
   - Configure additional VMs to act as various components of the IT infrastructure, including a Windows Server (Domain Controller), Windows 10 Client, and Kali Linux (Attacker Machine).

2. **Deploy ELK Stack:**
   - Install Elasticsearch to store and search log data.
   - Install Logstash to process and parse log data.
   - Install Kibana to visualize and analyze log data.

3. **Install Filebeat Agents:**
   - Install and configure Filebeat on the Domain Controller and other VMs to collect and ship logs to Logstash.

4. **Simulate Attacks:**
   - Conduct various attack simulations using the Kali Linux machine, such as phishing attacks, malware infections, and brute force attacks.
   - Capture and analyze logs from the simulated attacks using the ELK Stack.

5. **Incident Detection and Analysis:**
   - Use the ELK Stack to detect and analyze security incidents based on the collected logs.
   - Identify indicators of compromise (IoCs) and generate alerts for detected incidents.

6. **Develop Incident Response Procedures:**
   - Document incident response plans for each type of simulated attack.
   - Outline steps for containment, eradication, and recovery for each incident.
   - Generate detailed incident reports summarizing detection, analysis, and response actions.

7. **Documentation and Reporting:**
   - Maintain comprehensive documentation of the setup, configuration, and execution of the project.
   - Include logs, screenshots, and detailed descriptions of each step.
   - Provide incident reports and analysis for each simulated attack.
